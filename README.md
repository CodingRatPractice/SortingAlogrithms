# SortingAlogrithms
A Variety of sorting alogrithms.

## Technical Details

### Time complexity

#### In the code
To time the code I will be using a function 'run_sorting_algorithm' to run another function from the 'timeit' module. The function then prints the data.

## Types of algorithms shown

### Python's inbuilt sorting algorithm
Python has its own inbuilt algorithm you can use using:
sorted(array)
